Hi sweetie ‚ù§

I (Evan) created this repository with the hope that if I ask very nicely (and
maybe promise an apple pizza in return &#127829;), you (Haleigh) will help me 
learn how to use a multi-branch workflow with GitHub and R Studio. I finally
feel really comfortable using these tools for myself, and they have already
helped me so much -- but I have never collaborated with anyone else using
branches, pull requests, merges, etc.


It is **very** hard to teach an old dog new tricks (just ask Sadie's grumpy butt
üê∂), but I am going to at least attempt to get Andy to work with me this way. I
really don't want to go back to e-mailing files back and forth, or even using
Office 365. I want everything to stay linked to source code.


If I can convince him to learn to write this way, it will save me endless hours (days)
of translating comments and changes....and most importantly everything is
<u>automatically</u> version-controlled, so there is no need to keep track of
file names, numbers, etc. If any mistakes are made, we can always go back.
Hadley Wickham likens using Git to using ropes when rock climbing -- it's ok to take
a little bit of a risk and make drastic changes to your code or your writing,
because you can't fall very far.

```{r rock-climbing, fig.height=2.5, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rock-climbing.jpg') 
```

## Why I need your help

Because the McNitt attention span is about as long as Sadie sniffing my can of
beer (less than 5 seconds), I need to be sure that I have this method absolutely
licked before I try to explain it to him. That's why I am asking for your help
to learn how to merge branches, deal with pull requests, and repair merge conflicts _before_ I ask him to learn, so that I'm not doing it on the fly ad can easily answer his questions. 

## What else?
All the above is to say that I have a professional motivation for doing this, but I
actually envisage it being a useful tool for the two of us in the future. The lingo is a little confusing at first, but I can explain most of it, and you are computer savvy so you'll probbaly learn much faster than I did. And
given that this workflow is language-agnostic, meaning you can use Python,
SAS, or SQL right from R Studio, perhaps you too will be bitten by the R Markdown viper
and sucked into its vortex.....


```{r vortex, fig.height=2.5, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/animated_infinite_vortex.gif')
```


## OK so what will we actually do?

First you would need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/) (which is a local tool and completely separate from GitHub, though they play nicely together). Next you will need to create an account on GitHub [here](https://github.com/join). I can then add you as a collaborator to this repository. 

Once you're set up, I was thinking we would make an example .Rmd document and work on it together. It could be our plans for over winter....maybe coming up with some meal ideas and plans for fun things to do together. I don't want to waste any of your time, so if you're willing to help me with this, we can use a task we would need to do anyway. You will also have to learn 
to Markdown syntax, but that part is super easy- you can probably learn it in about 10 minutes. There are lots of good online tutorials; I used [this one](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) when I was first starting over this past summer. 

##
Markdown was originally invented for writing HTML code in a way that's easy for humans to read. It is a simple, plain-text document, and you just use regular punctuation marks to indicate how the text should be formatted. When you compile ("knit") the document from R Studio, the **rmarkdown** package calls a command-line tool called [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to translate your Markdown into HTML, Word, PDF, or many other formats. Probably that's more than enough detail for now, you don't really need to know any more to get started. If you find it interesting you could read more [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html) or elsewhere on the web. 

If you want to see the source code I wrote to create this very README file, you can browse it by simply clicking on the README.Rmd file on the repo home page (i.e. just scroll up). I wrote just a few HTML snippets for the emojis and some extra formatting, but you can see how simple the Markdown syntax is for bold, italics, hyperlinks, etc.

No rush as I know you have a lot going on right now. Maybe we can start when you come to PA. 

xoxo ‚ù§ Evan
